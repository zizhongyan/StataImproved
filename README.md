## üíø Installations 
Firstly you need to install the [Sublime Text 3 (ST3)](https://www.sublimetext.com/3).

### Installation via packge control. (easiest and recommendedüèÖ)
The installation is very simple as this package has been accepted by the [Sublime Text package manager](https://packagecontrol.io). There are 3 steps:

* Open the ST3, from the¬†main application menu, navigate to `Tools`, open the `Command Palette` (shortcut: <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>)
* Select `Package Control: Install Package`
* Search `Stata¬†Improved Editor` and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> to complete installation.

 
If you could not find the package control in your ST3, you will need to install it in advance. To install it, please go to [this webpage](https://packagecontrol.io/installation). 

Note that though the trial version of the ST3 is untimed and unlimited, the license need be purchased. 

### Manual installation
Open the ST3, click the Preferences-> Browse Packages-> Then you will reach the folder `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages`. Download [this Stata plugin from here](https://github.com/zizhongyan/StataImproved/archive/master.zip), and unpack the zip fil into that folder, and rename it as "Stata Improved Editor". 



## üé∑ Usage 
### üé∑Code Execution
<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>d</kbd> -- Execute (do) selected codes. 
As opposite to "do" the code by <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>d</kbd>, <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd> can "run" the code quietly in Stata. 

Note that if no code is selected, the current line of the code will be sent to Stata.

## Multiple Instances of Stata
If you openned multiple instances of Stata, please note that this plugin will send the code to your MOST RECENTLY OPENNED Stata session. 

If different versions of Stata are installed in your Mac (e.g. both Stata 14 and Stata 15), the plugin will send code to the most updated version of Stata (i.e. Stata 15). 


 
 
## Background information:
1, This plugin is motivated by the article ["Some notes on text editors for Stata users"](http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/bocode/t/textEditors.html#vim) By Nicolas J. Cox, and some part of the code is motivated and modified based on following packages: [StataEditor](https://github.com/mattiasnordin/) for the auto-completion, and [StataEnhanced by Andrew Heiss] (https://github.com/andrewheiss/) for the AppleScript.
).

This plugin basically creates a temporary do-file, which is then sent to the Stata to execute. All temporary cache files will be removed shortly when you close the Stata session.


2, This package is the Mac only. For Windows users, please follow the instructions in the Nicolas J. Cox's webpage above.
 
        
3, This plugin has been tested on Mac OS X Yosemite, El Capitan and macOS, and supports Stata 13, 14, 15 and 16 SE/MP/IC.
